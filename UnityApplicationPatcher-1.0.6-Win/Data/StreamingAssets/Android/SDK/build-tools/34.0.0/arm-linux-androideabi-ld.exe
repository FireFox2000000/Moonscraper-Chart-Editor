This dummy file substitutes for an old linker that used to be at its location.
The presence of this file ensures that old versions of AGP continue to trust build tools integrity
(which they would not if the file were removed).
Old versions of AGP will not be able to do compatibility mode RenderScript builds,
but everything else should work.
